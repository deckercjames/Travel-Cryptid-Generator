# Cryptid Board Generator

## Overview
This is a program that will create boards and corrisponding clues for the board game *Cryptid* by Hal Duncan and Ruth Veevers. I created it to make boards that could be taken backpacking. Yes/No indicators can be made with a marker or a standard set of shaped stickers.

## Running
Running `run.sh` will compile the appplication and run it in GUI mode. From there you can slect the number of boards you want to make. All boards will be "Hard" by default. You can specify how many of these should be "Easy". When they are generated, it will create a folder with the given name, a png for each board, and a single one-page pdf file that has al the clues for all players. Once printed out, the pdf can be cut up for each person.
